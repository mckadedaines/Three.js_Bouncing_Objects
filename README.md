# Interactive Solar System Simulation

## Overview

This project showcases an interactive 3D solar system simulation built with Three.js, demonstrating advanced web graphics capabilities and real-time physics-based animations. The simulation features a dynamic central star with realistic emission properties, orbiting planets with physically-based materials, and an immersive star field background.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Environment**

  - Orbital camera controls for full scene exploration
  - Dynamic zoom and rotation capabilities
  - Responsive design adapting to all screen sizes

- **Realistic Celestial Bodies**

  - Central star with dynamic lighting and emission
  - Four unique planets with distinct characteristics:
    - Mercury-like blue planet in close orbit
    - Mars-like orange planet in medium orbit
    - Earth-like green planet
    - Gas giant-inspired red planet in outer orbit
  - Physically-based materials with realistic reflections
  - Visible orbital paths

- **Advanced Rendering Features**
  - High-quality anti-aliasing
  - Bloom post-processing effects
  - Environment mapping for realistic reflections
  - Dynamic lighting system
  - High DPI display support
